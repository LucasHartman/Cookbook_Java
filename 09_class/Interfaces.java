/**
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ Interface
 * 
 * When you implement an interface, you are fufilling its constract
 * 
 * Rules ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 1. Interface Definition Rules Interfaces cannot be instantiated(can't create
 * instance of).
 * 
 * 2. All top-level types, including interfaces, cannot be marked projected or
 * private.
 * 
 * 3. Inteface are assumed to be abstract and cannot be marked final.
 * 
 * 4. Interfaces may include zero or more abstact methods.
 * 
 * 5. An interace can extend any number of interfaces.
 * 
 * 6. An interface reference may be cast to any reference that inherits the
 * interface, although this may produce an exception at runtime if the classes
 * arenâ€™t related.
 * 
 * 7. The compiler will only report an unrelated type error for an instanceof
 * operation with an interface on the right side if the reference on the left
 * side is a final class that does not inherit the interface.
 * 
 * 8. An interface method with a body must be marked default, private, static,
 * or private static (covered when studying for the 1Z0-816 exam).
 * 
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ Abstract
 * Interface Method Rules
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ 1.
 * Abstract methods can be defined only in abstract classes or interfaces.
 * 
 * 2. Abstract methods cannot be declared private or final.
 * 
 * 3. Abstract methods must not provide a method body/implementation in the
 * abstract class in which is it declared.
 * 
 * 4. Implementing an abstract method in a subclass follows the same rules for
 * overriding a method, including covariant return types, exception
 * declarations, etc.
 * 
 * 5. Interface methods without a body are assumed to be abstract and public.
 * 
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ Interface
 * Variables Rules
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ 1.
 * Interface variables are assumed to be public, static, and final.
 * 
 * 2. Because interface variables are marked final, they must be initialized
 * with a value when they are declared.
