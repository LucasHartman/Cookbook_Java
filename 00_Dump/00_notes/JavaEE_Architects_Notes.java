PROJECT LIFE CYCLE APPROACHES
-------------------------------------------------------------

-- Waterfall Approach
-   The waterfall approach entails performing all analysis and design for a project
    before  coding  and  testing. 

-- Agile Approaches
-   Agile approaches strive to separate a project into small component pieces that
    typically need few resources
-   Agile approaches can be viewed as a “family” of approaches
    with many varying implementations.
-   Most popular implementation of agile
    methods at the time of this writing appears to be Scrum.
-   Agile  approaches  dictate  that  you  break  the  problem  up  into  many  small
    problems (called stories) that take three weeks or less to implement
-   Each story is co-developed by two programmers using one machine.

-- Rational Unified Process
