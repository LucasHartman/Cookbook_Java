/**
 * Writing a main() Method (Chaper 1)
 * A Java program begins execution with its main() method.
 * Which is managed by the Java Virtula Machine (JVM)
 * 
 * public means anyplace in the program
 * 
 * static binds a method to its class so it can be called by just the class name
 * -  for example, Zoo.main(). Java doesn’t need to create an object to call the main() method
 * 
 * void represents the return type
 * 
 * main() method’s parameter list,
 * - represented as an array of java.lang.String objects
 * - The compiler accepts any of these:
 * 
 *      String[] args
 *      String args[]
 *      String... args;
 * 
 *      String[] options
 *      String options []
 *      String... options;
 * 
 * args
 * - The variable name args hints that this list contains values that were read in (arguments)
 * - 
 * 
 * []
 * The characters [] are brackets and represent an array. 
 * -  An array is a fixed-size list of items that are all of the same type. 
 * 
 * ...
 * The characters ... are called varargs (variable argument lists).
 *
