    -- recedence rules!
    
    1. When two operatos of the same precedence are in the same expresion,
    Java evaluates the expression from left to right.

    2. When parts of an expression are placed in parentheses,
    those pars are evaluted first.
    
    3. When parentheses are nested, the iinermost parentheses are evaluted fist.
